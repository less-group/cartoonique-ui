# New Theme Implementation

This branch implements a refreshed theme for the Letzteshemd store while maintaining all the custom pixar transformation functionality.

## Changes Made

1. **Color Scheme**: 
   - Updated colors with a more modern blue-grey palette
   - Changed primary button color to a softer blue (#4a7dbd)
   - Updated header/footer colors for better contrast
   - Adjusted text color to standard dark grey (#333333)

2. **UI Elements**:
   - Reduced border-radius on buttons and input fields for a more modern look
   - Adjusted shadow properties to be more subtle
   - Maintained all functional elements including pixar transform integration

3. **Templates**:
   - Created a test template (product.test-pixar.json) for testing the theme with pixar functionality
   - All other templates remain functional with the new color scheme

## Using the New Theme

The new theme is implemented as a branch. To use it:

1. Switch to this branch (`new-theme`)
2. Test with products that use the pixar transform feature
3. If all looks good, merge to main or deploy directly

## Custom Functionality Preserved

All custom functionality including the pixar transform feature has been preserved. The changes are purely visual and don't affect the underlying functionality of the store.

## Testing Checklist

Before finalizing the theme change, test the following:

- [ ] Product pages with pixar transform
- [ ] Cart functionality
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Page load speed
- [ ] All integrated third-party apps (reviews, etc.)
