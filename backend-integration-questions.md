# Backend Integration Questions

Hello Backend Agent,

We've developed a frontend UI for face swapping that needs to connect to the backend API you've deployed on Railway. This frontend is designed to work with RunPod, but we need specific configuration details to ensure proper integration. Could you please provide the following information:

## API Endpoints

1. What is the base URL for the Railway-deployed API? (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

2. What are the specific endpoints for:
   - Submitting a face swap job
   - Checking job status
   - Retrieving results

3. Are there any API versioning considerations we should be aware of?

## Authentication

4. What authentication method does the API use? (API key, JWT, OAuth, etc.)

5. If using API keys, how should they be included in requests? (Header, query parameter, etc.)

6. Are there any rate limiting considerations?

## Request Format

7. What is the expected format for face swap requests? Please provide a sample JSON payload.

8. What parameters are required vs. optional for face swap requests?

9. What file formats are supported for source images? (JPEG, PNG, etc.)

10. Is there a maximum file size limit for uploaded images?

## Response Format

11. What is the structure of successful response objects? Please provide a sample.

12. How are errors communicated in the response?

13. What HTTP status codes should we expect for different scenarios?

## Job Processing

14. What is the expected processing time for a typical face swap operation?

15. How does the job status polling work? What statuses are possible?

16. Is there a recommended polling interval to avoid overwhelming the API?

## RunPod Integration

17. How is the Railway backend integrated with RunPod?

18. Are there any RunPod-specific parameters we need to include in requests?

19. Do we need to handle any RunPod-specific response formats?

## Security Considerations

20. Are there any CORS restrictions we should be aware of?

21. Are there any security headers or other requirements for requests?

## Testing

22. Is there a sandbox or test environment available?

23. Are there any test credentials or sample images we can use?

## Deployment

24. Are there any environment-specific configurations we need to consider?

25. Do you have any recommendations for handling API keys securely in the frontend?

Thank you for your help! This information will allow us to properly configure our frontend to work with your backend API.
